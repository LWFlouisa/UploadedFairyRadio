title: "Now Taking Requests"
---
## Introduction
I'm currently taking requests for songs for singers and musicians for those creating music for RPG Maker titles. First as a background about myself: I'm mostly a webcomic creator and novelist, but practiced poetry for a few years in order to refine my prose writing ability.

My favorite forms of poetry are Francophone forms like "Alexandrine Line" and Lai, and Japanese forms like Haiku, Senryu, Tanka, and Haiku No Renga. I created my own hybrid form called Senryudeux, and other poetry forms are derived from this format.

## Format

[ Su-fi neh-di shu-deh ]

Gendered<br />
U Sufinerixude [ Su-fi neh-di shu-duh ]<br />
A Sufinerixeda [ Su-fi neh-di shu-dah ]<br />
Os Sufinerixedos [ Su-fi neh-di shu-doh ]

Derived from the hybrid French and Japanese poetry form Senryudeux, is 34 syllables split over three lines, and comes in a chain of three. Themes revolve around working class issues, capital punishment, and Japanese funerals.

## Format Of Request
Title: ( Name Of RPG Maker Game )
Genre: ( JRPG Type )
Description: ( General synopsis of the game, or if game dev can provide a pitch or blurb )
Screenshots: ( If you can get the screenshots, I need at least three. )

Any extra information relevant.

## Disclaimer
Note that I have the right to refuse if it doesn't fit my politics or idealogy. So I probably wont write a poem for a game about non-binary people. Sorry not sorry. Trans women aren't your pokemon tokens.
