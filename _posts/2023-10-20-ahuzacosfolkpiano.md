## Background Context
Ahuzacos folk music is the folk music of what was left over the US after the fall of the US empire, and the emergence of Neo-France and Neo-Japan, as contenders for the legacy of what was once the United States.

Here, both French and Francophone monuments are erected in memory of the fallen during the Franco-Japanese Wars.
