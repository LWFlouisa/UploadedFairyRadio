At ease Comrades<br />
The day of rest has arrived.<br />
For we are chosen to inherit<br />
the fruits of our ancestors past.<br />
Will you join in our last stand,<br />
And make our freedoms last?

May our reign<br />
last for one thousand, eight thousand years.<br />
Until the last speck of dust,<br />
withers into the sands of time.

Refrain<br />
We are the bakers with baguettes,<br />
and the farmers who grow cherry trees.<br />
From the fields of glory to the distant pastures.<br />
Let our freedoms last for many generations.

We were once slaves to distant lands from East to West,<br />
With languages not our own.<br />
Yet here we our survivors after the fall of Rome,<br />
We don't need kings or masters,<br />
because we our the masters of our own dominion.

Refrain<br />
We are the bakers with baguettes,<br />
and the farmers who grow cherry trees.<br />
From the fields of glory to the distant pastures.<br />
Let our freedoms last for many generations.

Those in other land may have guns and canons,<br />
yet we have something much stronger that is a lasting bond,<br />
Based on common values that blends<br />
our parents from distant lands.

Though we our from Europe and from Asia,<br />
We need be limited to this, for we are "Cool Japan",
Not Cruel France, with their imperial enablers in the East.
