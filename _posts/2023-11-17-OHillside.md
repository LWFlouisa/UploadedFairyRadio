O Hillside<br />
give me strength to reside.<br />
O Hillside<br />
mount of demon spawn in caverns<br />
below the land near the shore.<br />
Moonlight all the year long.

O my hillside<br />
with your overlook...<br />
crow passes swiftly.

O Hillside<br />
give me strength to reside.<br />
O Hillside<br />
mount of demon spawn in caverns<br />
below the land near the shore.<br />
Moonlight all the year long.

And on mountain<br />
where I see the sea crash,<br />
wind passes me by.

And I fill the chill<br />
of passers by.
