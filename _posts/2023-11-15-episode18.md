### Color Palette In Question
This is my homemade ink palette, which often gets confused for Dark Academia as well. But this one specifically revolves around murder, and more specifically mercy killing and angels of mercy, that murder their victims with Arsenic, and dress in Gunmetal Grey.

As a side note, gunmetal can also be a shade of Cyan blue as well, which I'll cover in the Vipers And Tigers palette.
