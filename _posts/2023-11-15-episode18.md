### Original Palette
This is my homemade ink palette, which often gets confused for Dark Academia as well. But this one specifically revolves around murder, and more specifically mercy killing and angels of mercy, that murder their victims with Arsenic, and dress in Gunmetal Grey.

As a side note, gunmetal can also be a shade of Cyan blue as well, which I'll cover in the Vipers And Tigers palette.

Taken to its logical limit, it would never end up as colorful as people who dislike monochromatic manga are expecting:

In practice I don't usually use all these colors, but rather pick one of the monochromatic palettes, and the red shades. It's also worth baring in mind this is the color of the inks themselves, and doesn't include the color of the actual paper I use ( generally Bristol Board, Watercolor Paper, or Cotton Canvases ). That ends up diluting the color.

### Later Refinements
The original webcomic palette was designed to make use of the limited supply of ink I was able to obtain do to lack of funds, when I wasn't using homemade ink. Homemade ink ia seperate color palette that will come up soon.

The next one, which I use more these days, functions as the base for the Neon Bassanova color palette.

### Future Developments
I'm considering seeing where the original green colors in homemade ink evolves into.
