### Original Palette
This is my homemade ink palette, which often gets confused for Dark Academia as well. But this one specifically revolves around murder, and more specifically mercy killing and angels of mercy, that murder their victims with Arsenic, and dress in Gunmetal Grey.

As a side note, gunmetal can also be a shade of Cyan blue as well, which I'll cover in the Vipers And Tigers palette.

### Later Refinements
The original webcomic palette was designed to make use of the limited supply of ink I was able to obtain do to lack of funds, when I wasn't using homemade ink. Homemade ink ia seperate color palette that will come up soon.

The next one, which I use more these days, functions as the base for the Neon Bassanova color palette.

### Future Developments
I'm considering seeing where the original green colors in homemade ink evolves into.
