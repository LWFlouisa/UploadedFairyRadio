Mr. Pataki was surprised by how quickly Arnold learned the ins and out of his profession. And how he developed the reputation of being able to solve whatever bugs their computers head, without having to involve a professional mechanic.

Although he had never been close to Helga, Mr. Pataki knew that she was constantly on Shortman’s mind after his daughter passed on. He had warned his wife about not drinking and driving, but she never listened. When Arnold plugged into the thumb drive into the port, every day felt like he was in the car with Helga before crashes head on into a speeding eighteen wheeler. And after a suddem flash of light, he passed out.

-- You should get some rest shortman.

-- But your thumb drive error?

-- I’ll reformat it myself, I don’t want you dying on me like Helga.

When she was a live, Mr. Pataki always took Helga for granted, yet now she was all that he could think about. For him, Arnold became like a son her never had, whom had always wanted to run the family business. One of these days shortman would overwork himself to much, like people in Japan, with their overly long work weeks. Ordinarily he didn’t care much about how overworked his employees were, but Shortman was almost like a son to him.

-- Here’s your week’s paycheck. don’t die on me kiddo.

In earlier years it would be Helga that built a shrine in the image of Shortman, and yet now with her passing, he had his own image of Helga in the room of a decorated peach he kept in a special section of his bookshelf that Gertie would never see. He wasn’t sure how Mr. Pataki would take it, as he had never been quit the same same sense Helga lost her head in a car crash. Shortman worried that he would percieve that as mocking his daughter.

But in a way it was like a momento that he never got from her when she was not six feet under, a kind of momento mori. In this way he would relive day and night with the images in his head of Helga’s final moments. They had not yet developed the technology to plug in someone’s severed head into a life preservation tank, only crudely attempt to give life to those without their heads. Thus Helga’s demise was a slow and agonizing one:

Belle morue.<br />
A rose cut in many pieces.<br />
Belle morue,<br />
planted in the dirt off seasons,<br />
when the rain had not long come.<br />
Longing for the rain, he wakes.<br />
Belle morue.

Moonlight shines long<br />
over old boarding house.<br />
Once pigs and cats.

Now a land of dust. Just before the Christmas season. He had once looked forward to gifts, From his lady dawn in waiting. Yet now she waits in the tunnel into the light.

And when he wakes, he shuddes in fright, when the crows that sang to him in the windows, reminded him of the lost Helga:

Belle morue.<br />
A rose cut in many pieces.<br />
Belle morue,<br />
planted in the dirt off seasons,<br />
when the rain had not long come.<br />
Longing for the rain, he wakes.<br />
Belle morue.

To think it took an untimely death to turn his life around. Everything changed, but he knew he had a job to do, as the main reason he worked for Mr. Pataki, was to hold onto something to remind him of his true love.

But the image of Helga’s passing made him lose all will to live.

He jumped on the train with the ghost with the accordion, hopped on with him, and asked for an extra accordion, in the path to hell, where his one true love Helga Pataki awaited, with open arms.

Shortman was found laying with his eyes open on a graveyard.
	He is taken by a shadowy figure into hell.
